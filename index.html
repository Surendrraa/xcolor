    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how X Color ("we", "our", or "extension") collects, uses, and handles your information when you use our browser extension.</p>
    
    <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
    
    <p>Our X Color is designed to help users pick colors, analyze webpage color schemes, generate gradients, and manage color palettes. The extension operates primarily within your browser and minimizes data transmission to external servers.</p>
    
    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    
    <p>The X Color extension respects your privacy and is designed with data minimization in mind. Our approach to data is:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Does not collect personal information</li>
        <li>Does not track browsing history</li>
        <li>Does not use cookies or similar tracking technologies</li>
        <li>May collect anonymous, aggregated usage statistics to help improve the extension</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Any color data generated during the use of the extension (such as picked colors, palettes, or gradients) is stored locally in your browser and is not transmitted to external servers. This data is stored within your Chrome profile based on the account you use and is not accessible to us as the extension owners.</p>
    
    <h2>Local Storage</h2>
    
    <p>The extension uses browser local storage to save your color history, preferences, and settings to improve your experience. This data remains on your device and is not accessible to us or any third parties.</p>
    
    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    
    <p>Our extension requires certain permissions to function properly, including:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>activeTab:</strong> To access the current tab for color picking functionality</li>
        <li><strong>storage:</strong> To save your color history and extension preferences locally</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>These permissions are used solely for the purpose of providing the extension's core functionality and not for collecting user data.</p>
    
    <h2>AI Features</h2>
    
    <p>For the AI-powered features, we utilize algorithms that run locally within the extension. No image or website data is sent to external AI services.</p>
    
    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    
    <p>Our extension may use Google Chrome's extension APIs to provide functionality. Please refer to <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy" target="_blank">Google's Privacy Policy</a> for information on how Google handles your data.</p>
    
    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Chrome Web Store and updating the extension accordingly. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>
